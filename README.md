### Tagline : 
<p>To give the news about weather changes and help farmer prepare for any kind of disaster, we provide them with headlines, so their crops can be protected by the harsh weather.</p>

### Problem it solves :
<p> Farmers rely on suitable weather to make their crops thrive and grow healthy. But when the same weather suddenly changes, it brings disaster ruining the crops of the farmers before they have time to prepare themselves and save the crops. </p>
<p>Therefore, our solution help farmers by notifying them about weather changes and any other disaster, so they can prepare for the weather and have a chance to save the crops from falling completely. </p>
<p>Our solution takes use the weather forecast data to give not only warning, but also suggestions about a good time to sow the seeds for the next season, cutting the crops etc. 
</p>

### Challenges we ran into:
<p>One of the biggest challenges we faced was how little information the farmers have about technologies. It made it difficult for us to deliver the information to them. Along with that, farmers speak and understand different languages, therefore, delivering the data in their preferred language was another hurdle.</p>
	<p>To overcome the challenges, we decided to deliver the information in the most basic format, that is using the SMS system, as most farmers at least have some sort of mobile phone. So, deliver all the information, an SMS will be sent to the number registered by the farmer in the preferred language used by them.</p>
	<p>The information along with some other perks can be seen by the farmer on the website as well. But for those who are not familiar with technologies and how to navigate the internet, the SMS service will help them provide all the information.</p>
	<p>The next challenge was to make the it assessable to all the farmers at a very low cost. So, to overcome this challenge we made sure the farmers find our services worthy of their money. Therefore, a trial is provided to the farmer for the first month of subscription with all the perks and then a minimum amount of pricing will be charged only for the services needed. This ensure that they only pay for things they want and are not overwhelmed by the price.</p>
	<p>To keep the prices minimum, we researched various service providers who provided services we wanted at a low cost.</p>
